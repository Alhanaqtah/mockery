## Local development setup

This project uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/), please see the [Install Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) and
[Taskfile usage documentation](https://taskfile.dev/usage/) for more information.

Once installed, run `task -l` for list of valid targets.

## Working with documentation

We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [mkdocs-material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

To preview the documentation locally, run `task mkdocs.serve`. The task will install the required mkdocs plugins and theme
and run the mkdocs server with real-time updating/refreshing.
